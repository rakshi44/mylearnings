            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Safety Critical System Verification and Validation | Integration testing | Embedded Software Engineer | CSM®| Systems Engineer | Firmware testing</p>
            <p> With a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and a Certified ScrumMaster (CSM®) credential, I am a passionate and proficient Sr. System Verification Engineer at Fresenius Medical Care, a global leader in dialysis products and services. 
            <p>I have proven expertise in analyzing and interpreting system requirements, designing detailed test cases, executing both manual and automated testing, and reporting defects for medical device systems. I ensure compliance with regulatory standards, such as ISO13845 and IEC 62304, and support risk assessment and mitigation efforts. I also contribute to validation of the entire medical device system and share best practices with my team. </p>
            <p> Previously, I worked as an Embedded Software Engineer at Abbott and Collins Aerospace, where I developed and verified software modules for error handling and avionics subsystems, using hardware-in-the-loop equipment and various tools, such as Synergy, DOORS, and RTRT. I demonstrated a thorough understanding of the software development lifecycle and its various stages, as well as the DO-178C standards for safety-critical aerospace products. I also streamlined power system configuration and partitioning, resulting in significant cost savings for the customer.</p>
            <p>I am recognized for my analytical and problem-solving skills, exceptional communication and decision-making skills, and customer-centric approach. I am motivated by challenging and innovative projects that improve the quality and safety of life-saving products and services. I value collaboration, learning, and continuous improvement in my work. </p>
